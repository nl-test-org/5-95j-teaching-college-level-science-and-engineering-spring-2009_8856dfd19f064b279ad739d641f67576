At the end of each lesson, students completed feedback forms to comment on what worked and what was confusing during that lesson. At the start of the following lesson, I addressed these comments. In these video discussions, I have linked the lesson with its corresponding questions as a learning aid, even though I would not have been able to do so in real time. Due to technical difficulties, only a portion of lecture 1 is available for viewing; lecture 6 is missing except for the answers to lecture 6 questions generated in lecture 7.{{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/video-discussions/introduction" section="Video Discussions" title="Course Introduction" description="Topics covered: Course Introduction Instructor: Dr. Sanjoy Mahajan" thumbnail="https://img.youtube.com/vi/S9uGFKoRGUU/default.jpg" >}} {{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/video-discussions/lecture-1-general-principles-of-teaching" section="Video Discussions" title="Lecture 1: General Principles of Teaching" description="Topics covered: General principles of teaching Instructor: Dr. Sanjoy Mahajan" thumbnail="https://img.youtube.com/vi/wy-LqFDwMuM/default.jpg" >}} {{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/video-discussions/lecture-2-teaching-equations" section="Video Discussions" title="Lecture 2: Teaching Equations" description="Topics covered: Teaching equations Instructor: Dr. Sanjoy Mahajan" thumbnail="https://img.youtube.com/vi/gyboshu425k/default.jpg" >}} {{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/video-discussions/lecture-3-taking-account-of-misconceptions-avoiding-rote-learning" section="Video Discussions" title="Lecture 3: Taking Account of Misconceptions; Avoiding Rote Learning" description="Topics covered: Taking account of misconceptions; avoiding rote learning Instructor: Dr. Sanjoy Mahajan" thumbnail="https://img.youtube.com/vi/etbY4_d3peg/default.jpg" >}} {{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/video-discussions/lecture-4-designing-homework-and-exam-problems" section="Video Discussions" title="Lecture 4: Designing Homework and Exam Problems" description="Topics covered: Designing homework and exam problems Instructor: Dr. Sanjoy Mahajan" thumbnail="https://img.youtube.com/vi/8YQf4xOEhag/default.jpg" >}} {{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/video-discussions/lecture-5-course-design" section="Video Discussions" title="Lecture 5: Course Design" description="Topics covered: Course design Instructor: Dr. Sanjoy Mahajan" thumbnail="https://img.youtube.com/vi/V-eWuHXZGnw/default.jpg" >}} {{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/video-discussions/lecture-6-teaching-interactively-in-large-and-small-groups" section="Video Discussions" title="Lecture 6: Teaching Interactively in Large and Small Groups" description="Topics covered: Teaching interactively in large and small groups Instructor: Dr. Sanjoy Mahajan" thumbnail="https://img.youtube.com/vi/5uTd3WzQulo/default.jpg" >}} {{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/video-discussions/lecture-7-lecture-planning-and-performing" section="Video Discussions" title="Lecture 7: Lecture Planning and Performing" description="Topics covered: Lecture planning and performing Instructor: Dr. Sanjoy Mahajan" thumbnail="https://img.youtube.com/vi/RyKmgyGH5dw/default.jpg" >}} {{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/video-discussions/lecture-8-teaching-with-blackboards-and-slides" section="Video Discussions" title="Lecture 8: Teaching with Blackboards and Slides" description="Topics covered: Teaching with blackboards and slides Instructor: Dr. Sanjoy Mahajan" thumbnail="https://img.youtube.com/vi/QcRteDU9Eco/default.jpg" >}} {{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/video-discussions/lecture-9-political-barriers-to-educational-change" section="Video Discussions" title="Lecture 9: Political Barriers to Educational Change" description="Topics covered: Political barriers to educational change Instructor: Dr. Sanjoy Mahajan" thumbnail="https://img.youtube.com/vi/PaYY0e9eE2A/default.jpg" >}} {{< video-gallery-item href="/sections/video-discussions/lecture-10-course-summary-and-your-questions" section="Video Discussions" title="Lecture 10: Course Summary and Your Questions" description="Topics covered: Course summary and your questions Instructor: Dr. Sanjoy Mahajan" thumbnail="https://img.youtube.com/vi/IXjwZlJ9Uvk/default.jpg" >}}
